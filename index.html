				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>Take a few moments to read the following problem and think about the answer.</li>
						<li>Intuition would suggest (b) is the answer, because of Linda's concern for social justice.</li>
						<li>CLICK BUT correct answer is (a): This is not an opinion question, it's entirely a matter of logic</li>
						<li>Remember, question asked which is more CLICK likely</li>
						<li>Bank tellers who are also feminists‚Äîjust like bank tellers who yodel or despise
							cilantro‚Äîare a
							subset of all bank tellers, and subsets can never be larger than the full set they're a part of.</li>
						<li>In 1983, two researchers from Stanford and UBC posed Linda problem to study participants at different
							times of day (9am
							and 8pm) to illustrate ‚Äúconjunction fallacy‚Äù - one of the ways in which our reasoning goes awry.</li>

						<li>Linda problem is an analytic task - has a single correct answer that can be reached via logic</li>
						<li>Adults tend to perform best on this sort of thinking during the mornings - when they are most VIGILANT
						</li>
						<li>With Linda Problem, politically tinged material about Linda's college experiences is a distraction. It

						<li>CLICK Consider discussing with your team whether rescheduling standup could facilitate uninterrupted

						<li>CLICK Sometimes an emergency or deadline comes up and you're forced to do deep analytical tasks during
							your

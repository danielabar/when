							<li>2 Cornell University sociologists, Michael Macy and Scott Golder analyzed over 500M tweets from 2.4M
								users in 84

							<li>Fed tweets into LIWX (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) to analyze emotion</li>
							<li>Found positive affect (language expressing feelings of being active, engaged, hopeful) generally rose

								plummeted in the afternoon, and climbed back up again in the early evening</li>
							<li>Found the same temporal affective patterns regardless of geographic region, ethnicity, religion or

						<li>2006 study by behavioral scientists asked over 900 American women (mix of races, ages, household
							incomes
							and education levels) to characterize their emotions at frequent intervals throughout the day: happy,
							frustrated, enjoying myself, annoyed etc.</li>
						<li>Researches found consistent and strong bimodal pattern: Positive affect climbed in the morning hours,,
							reaching optimal emotional point around midday, then good mood plummeted and stayed low throughout
							afternoon,
							and rises again in the early evening.</li>
						<li>Researchers also found negative affect (feeling frustrated, worried, hassled) showed a reverse pattern -
							rising in the
							afternoon and sinking as the day drew to a close. Combining positive and negative to chart net good mood
							(hourly ratings
							for happiness and subtract ratings for frustration) - pattern is: Peak, Trough, Rebound</li>

					<ul>
						<li>In a 2013 study, 3 American business school professors analyzed more than 26,000 earnings calls from
							over 2,100 public
							companies over 6 and a half years using linguistic algorithms similar to those used in the Twitter study
						</li>
						<li>They examined whether the time of day influenced the emotional tenor of these critical
							conversations and, as a
							consequence, perhaps even the price of the company‚Äôs stock.</li>
						<li>Calls held first thing in the morning turned out to be reasonably upbeat and positive.</li>
						<li>As the day progressed, the ‚Äútone grew more negative and less resolute.‚Äù</li>
						<li>In the afternoon, negativity deepened, with mood recovering only after the market‚Äôs closing bell.</li>
						<li>Amazingly, his pattern held ‚Äúeven after controlling for factors such as industry norms, financial
							distress, growth opportunities, and the news that companies were reporting.‚Äù. Generally: afternoon calls
							‚Äúwere more negative, irritable, and combative‚Äù than morning calls.</li>
						<li>time of the call and the subsequent mood it engendered influenced companies‚Äô stock prices. Shares
							declined
							in response to negative tone‚Äîagain, even after adjusting for actual good news or bad news‚Äî‚Äúleading to
							temporary stock mispricing for firms hosting earnings calls later in the day.‚Äù (share prices eventually
							righted themselves)</li>
						<li>Results show economic rationality is no match for a biological clock forged during a few million years
							of evolution. Even ‚Äúsophisticated economic agents acting in real and highly incentivized settings are

				<h2>The Linda Problem</h2>
				<p class="read-left">
					Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. In college, Linda majored in philosophy. As
					a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and participated in
					antinuclear demonstrations.
					Which is more likely?
				</p>
				<ul class="list-plain">
					<li>
						<span class="fragment highlight-red">
							a. Linda is a bank teller.
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>b. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>Intuition would suggest (b) is the answer, concern for social justice and anti-nuke demonstrations would
							suggest an
							activist.</li>
						<li>BUT correct answer is (a): This is not an opinion question, it‚Äôs entirely a matter of logic (remember,
							question asked
							which is more LIKELY): Bank tellers who are also feminists‚Äîjust like bank tellers who yodel or despise
							cilantro‚Äîare a
							subset of all bank tellers, and subsets can never be larger than the full set they‚Äôre a part of.</li>
						<li>In 1983, two researchers from Stanford and UBC posed Linda problem to study participants at different
							times of day (9am
							and 8pm) to illustrate ‚Äúconjunction fallacy‚Äù - one of the ways in which our reasoning goes awry.</li>
						<li>People were much more likely to answer correctly earlier in the day than later.</li>

				<h2>Vigilance</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Our cognitive abilities do not remain static over the course of a day. During the sixteen or so hours
							we‚Äôre awake, We
							are smarter, faster, dimmer, slower, more creative, and less creative in some parts of the day than
							others.</li>
						<li>Linda problem is an analytic task - has a single correct answer that can be reached via logic</li>
						<li>Adults tend to perform best on this sort of thinking during the mornings - when they are most VIGILANT
						</li>
						<li>With Linda Problem, politically tinged material about Linda‚Äôs college experiences is a distraction. It
							has no
							relevance in resolving the question itself. When our minds are in vigilant mode, we can disregard such
							distractions.</li>
						<li>But vigilance has limits, after several hours mental guards grow tired, - Then sloppy logic, irrelevant
							information can ‚Äúsneak in‚Äù</li>
						<li>Alertness and energy levels tend to plummet during afternoons, with that comes a corresponding fall in
							ability to
							remain focused and analytic powers decline.</li>

						<li>This is an ‚Äúinsight problem‚Äù</li>
						<li>Unlike Linda problem, Reasoning in a methodical, algorithmic way won‚Äôt yield a correct answer.</li>
